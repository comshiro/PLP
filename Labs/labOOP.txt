### 3. **Interfaces**
Introduce interfaces to define shared behavior without implementation.

```coq
Inductive InterfaceDecl :=
  | interface : string -> list (string * list AExp) -> InterfaceDecl. (* Interface name and method signatures *)
```

Example:
```coq
Definition DrawableInterface :=
  interface "Drawable"
    [("draw", []); ("erase", [])]. (* Abstract methods *)
```

---

### 4. **Inheritance and Method Overriding**
Enable child classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.

Example:
```coq
Definition ColoredPointClass :=
  class "ColoredPoint" (Some "Point") (* Inherits from Point *)
    [("color", public, num 0)] (* Additional attributes *)
    [("move", public, seq (assign "x" (var "new_x"))
                          (assign "y" (var "new_y"))) (* Override method *)].
```

---

### 5. **Polymorphism (Dynamic Dispatch)**
Support dynamic method resolution based on the runtime type of objects.

This could involve:
- A special syntax for virtual methods.
- A construct for dynamic dispatch:
  ```coq
  Inductive Stmt :=
  | dynamicCall : string -> string -> list AExp -> Stmt. (* Object, method name, arguments *)
  ```

Example:
```coq
Definition DrawShape :=
  dynamicCall "shape" "draw" [].
```

---

### 6. **Abstract Classes**
Add syntax for abstract classes, which cannot be instantiated directly.

```coq
Inductive ClassDecl :=
  | abstractClass : string -> (* Abstract class name *)
                    option string -> (* Parent class name *)
                    list (string * AccessModifier * AExp) -> (* Attributes *)
                    list (string * AccessModifier * Stmt) -> (* Methods *)
                    ClassDecl.
```

Example:
```coq
Definition AbstractShapeClass :=
  abstractClass "Shape" None
    [("color", public, num 0)] (* Common attributes *)
    [("draw", public, skip)]. (* Abstract methods *)
```

---

### 7. **Exception Handling**
Introduce constructs for try-catch-finally blocks.

```coq
Inductive Stmt :=
| tryCatch : Stmt -> Stmt -> Stmt -> Stmt. (* try, catch, finally blocks *)
```

Example:
```coq
Definition ErrorHandling :=
  tryCatch
    (assign "x" (div (num 1) (var "y"))) (* try *)
    (assign "error" (num 1))             (* catch *)
    skip.                                (* finally *)
```

---

### 8. **Lambda Functions**
Enable first-class functions for functional programming capabilities.

```coq
Inductive AExp :=
| lambda : list string -> Stmt -> AExp. (* Parameters, body *)
```

Example:
```coq
Definition IncrementLambda :=
  lambda ["x"] (assign "result" (add (var "x") (num 1))).
```

---

### 9. **Annotations**
Support for annotations, often used for metadata or custom behaviors.

```coq
Inductive Annotation :=
| annotate : string -> AExp -> Annotation.

Inductive ClassDecl :=
  | class : string -> option string -> list Annotation -> (* Annotations *)
            list (string * AccessModifier * AExp) -> 
            list (string * AccessModifier * Stmt) -> ClassDecl.
```

Example:
```coq
Definition AnnotatedClass :=
  class "MyClass" None
    [annotate "deprecated" (num 1)]
    [("value", public, num 0)]
    [("getValue", public, seq (assign "result" (var "value")) skip)].
```

---

### 10. **Constructors with Overloading**
Extend constructor syntax to support overloading.

```coq
Inductive Stmt :=
| constructor : string -> list (list (string * AExp)) -> Stmt. (* Overloaded constructors *)

Definition PointConstructors :=
  constructor "Point"
    [[("x", num 0); ("y", num 0)]; (* Default constructor *)
     [("x", num 1); ("y", num 1)]]. (* Overloaded constructor *)
```

---

### Summary

You could incorporate these concepts into your syntax:
1. **Static members** for shared data or methods.
2. **Encapsulation** using getters and setters.
3. **Interfaces** for shared behavior definitions.
4. **Inheritance** with method overriding.
5. **Polymorphism** with dynamic dispatch.
6. **Abstract classes** for common behaviors.
7. **Exception handling** for error management.
8. **Lambda functions** for higher-order programming.
9. **Annotations** for metadata.
10. **Constructor overloading** for flexibility.

Let me know which of these you'd like to implement!
