This repository contains my lab work for the Principles of Programming Languages subject, implemented in Coq using Gallina. The course focuses on formal methods for defining programming languages, including syntax, semantics, interpreters, and type systems. The work here showcases the theoretical and practical application of these concepts using the Coq proof assistant.

This work explores algebraic datatypes, inductive definitions, and operational semantics, including both big-step semantics, which evaluates entire program executions at once, and small-step semantics, which models step-by-step execution. It also includes the implementation of type systems for checking and inference, certified compilation with correctness proofs, and program verification techniques such as proofs by induction and logical reasoning about program properties. The main language used for formalization is IMP, a simple imperative language with variables, arithmetic expressions, conditionals, and loops, along with extensions for additional constructs.
